<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The DataStax Enterprise for PCF tile is currently in closed beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.

This documentation describes the DataStax Enterprise for PCF for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 
The DataStax Enterprise for PCF enables developers to provision a dedicated DataStax Enterprise (DSE) cluster on-demand to build cloud-scale app.  

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

DataStax Enterprise for PCF enables app developers to create a dedicated DSE cluster to serve their apps.
In its current closed beta period, the DataStax Enterprise for PCF service offers three plans:

+ sample-bronze-plan
+ sample-silver-plan
+ sample-gold-plan

PCF tile administrators can associate different VM types to each plan.
Developers can then use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to create dedicated instances
of the service plans and bind the instances to their apps.

Creating a DataStax Enterprise for PCF service instance and binding it to an app creates
a database connection from an app to a backend dedicated DSE cluster.
This lets developers use the connection to manipulate data residing on the dedicated DataStax Enterprise Cassandra NoSQL database cluster.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

DataStax Enterprise for PCF lets PCF developers:

* Self-provision a DSE cluster on-demand from three different service plans.
* Connect PCF apps to a dedicated DSE cluster.
* Decommission a DSE cluster.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

<p>The DataStax Enterprise for PCF has the following limitations:</p>

<ul>

    Users will not receive general support from DataStax if their DataStax Entrprise clusters are provisioned
    using the DataStax Enterprise for PCF during the beta period.</li>
<li>The provisioned DSE clusters do not provide DSE Search, DSE Analytics, and DSE Graph features.</li>
<li>Developers are limited to three service plans.</li>
<li>The DataStax Enterprise for PCF tile can be installed in PCF deployments that run in multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
    However, the DSE service can only provision cluster nodes within a single AZ.</li>
